	In an \underline{unrooted tree}: nodes of degree 1 are called \textbf{leaf}. \newline
	In a \underline{rooted tree}: nodes of outdegree 0 are called \textbf{leaf}. \newline
	All other nodes are called \textbf{internal nodes}. 
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}
	For a \underline{rooted tree} :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item there has to be one node with indegree 0, the root 
		\item The tree is called \textbf{biforcation (binary, fully resolved)} if each internal node has degree 3\\
		(In directed rooted tree: indegree 1, outdegree 2)\\
		and \textbf{multiforcation}, else. 
		
	\end{itemize}

\begin{defi}
	Let T rooted tree and $v \in V$ node in T. A \textbf{subtree} $T_v$  \underline{rooted } at v looks like this: \\

	$T_v$ is tree with root v that is \textbf{induced by v} and all nodes reachable from v by a directed path starting at v.

\subsection{Tree traversals}
For the following algorithms let T be a biforcating rooted tree (compare figure 17)\\
(The algorithms run analog for multiforcation trees)

		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture} [sibling distance=13pt]
		\Tree[.$\zeta$ [.j [.h [.g a b ] c ] e ] f ]
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{We will use this tree T for all traversals }
	\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Pre-order traversal (top down)} \\
	\textit{Examine (e.g. print out a lable) the root of T\\
		Traverse \underline{left} subtree\\
		Travers \underline{right} subtree} \\
	\textbf{Result on tree T:} $ \zeta, j, h, g, a, b, c, i, d, e, f$ \\
	(Algoritmic representation: root, traverse $T_j$, traverse $T_f$)

	\item \textbf{Post-order traversal (bottom up)} \\
	\textit{Traverse \underline{left} subtree\\
		Travers \underline{right} subtree\\
			Examine} \\		
	\textbf{Result on tree T:} $ a, b, g, c, h, d, e, i, j, f, \zeta$ \\
		
	\item \textbf{Inorder traversal } \\
	\textit{Traverse \underline{left} subtree,\\
		Examine,\\
		Travers \underline{right} subtree
		} \\		
	\textbf{Result on tree T:} $ f, \zeta, e, j, c, h, b, g, a$ \\
	Extention for multification trees: Sometimes it might be required to examine the root between several children. 
	
	\item \textbf{Break first } \\
	\textit{Put root $\zeta$ in a queue\\
		While queue not empty\\
		Pop off queue\\
		Examine\\
		Add children to end of queue}\\
	\textbf{Result on tree T: }
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		& Q:= $\zeta$ & v $\leftarrow \zeta$ \\
		v: $\zeta$ & Q = (j, f) & v $\leftarrow$ j\\
		v: j & Q = (f, h, i) & v $\leftarrow$ f \\
		v: f & Q = (h, i) & v $\leftarrow$  h \\
		v: h & Q = (i, g, c) & v $\leftarrow$ i \\
		v: i & Q = (g, c, d, e) & v $\leftarrow$ g \\
		v: g & Q = (c, d, e, a, b) & v $\leftarrow$ c\\
		v: c & Q = (d, e, a, b) & \dots \\
		v: d & Q = (e, a, b) & \\
		v: e & Q = (a, b) &\\
		v: a & Q = (b) &\\
		v: b & Q = () & \\ 	
	\end{tabular}
	\\The first row of the tabular represents the order in which the nodes where examined. \\
	Proof: Quque higher level $\rightarrow$ first in quque. 	
	
	\item Pre-, post- and Inorder traversal are \textbf{depth first traversals}.
